# Walmart Data Analysis

This project involves data analysis of a set of 45 Walmart stores from different regions. The purpose of the analysis is to gain insights into the available data before making major changes. The analysis is performed in Excel, and the findings and recommendations are summarized below.<br> </br>

## Time of the year and weekly store sales

To understand the relationship between time of the year and weekly sales, the following analyses were conducted:

### Average Weekly Sale by Week

A line graph was prepared to visualize the average weekly sales by week. It was observed that weeks 47 and 99 have the highest average weekly sales. These weeks correspond to the week preceding Christmas, which is a major holiday in the US for the years 2010 and 2011. This indicates that the markdowns implemented by Walmart for the holiday season, especially Christmas, are highly effective in driving sales.

### Weekly Sales Comparison for Holiday and Non-Holiday Weeks

To compare the weekly sales during holiday and non-holiday weeks, a boxplot was created. The analysis revealed notable distinctions between these two categories. Weeks that coincide with holidays exhibit higher values for quartiles, maximum and minimum points, and have no outliers. On the other hand, non-holiday weeks show a greater number of outliers, suggesting that holidays significantly impact the distribution and variability of sales data.

## Weekly sales among stores

To examine the variation in weekly sales among different stores, the following analyses were performed:

### Weekly Sales by Store

A boxplot was generated to illustrate the weekly sales by store. The top three performing stores were found to be Store 4, Store 2, and Store 10, while the lowest performing stores were Store 5, Store 3, and Store 9. Store 4 exhibited a larger spread of sales data, indicating higher variability in performance. Conversely, Store 5 demonstrated relatively consistent sales figures. Outliers in both cases represented strong sales performance.

### Average Weekly Sales by Store

A bar chart was created to display the average weekly sales for each store. Store 20 emerged as the store with the highest average weekly sales, while Store 33 had the lowest average weekly sales.

## Pattern of weekly sales between selected stores

To explore the sales patterns of specific stores, line graphs were generated for the store with the largest maximum sales, highest average sales, and lowest performing sales. Upon closer observation, it was evident that Store 14 and Store 20 exhibited striking similarities in their patterns, despite Store 20 having the highest average weekly sales. In contrast, Store 33 consistently experienced lower sales and did not follow the same pattern as Stores 14 and 20. This suggests that Store 33 operates under different market conditions or faces unique challenges compared to the other two stores.

## Challenges and Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following challenges and recommendations are suggested for the regional manager:

1. **Time-based Incentives**: Implement markdowns and other incentives during the 4th week to stimulate purchases, as it exhibits the lowest average sales despite being situated between two holidays. Extending these incentives to week 52 can help mitigate the abrupt decline and maintain a more stable level of profits.

2. **Store-specific Strategies**: Investigate why Store 33 lacks sales spikes during holidays compared to Stores 14 and 20. Improve the advertising and promotion of markdowns
